Power Bi Dashboard
what is the Problem? and How to Solve?

Problem: High Employee Attrition (237 resignations, 16.1%) but HR team lacked clear visibility on which factors (salary, age, job role) were driving it.

Solution: Collected & cleaned 1,470 HR records using SQL & Excel, then designed an interactive Power BI dashboard to track attrition by demographics, education, and salary slabs.

Tools/Approach: Built DAX measures & KPIs (Attrition Rate, Avg Age, Avg Salary), created visualizations (attrition by job role, salary, age group), and used Generative AI tools to generate automated insights and summaries for HR reports.

Result/Impact: Enabled data-driven HR decisions, identified high-risk groups (Laboratory Technicians, Sales Executives) â†’ provided actionable insights to reduce attrition and improve retention strategies.
